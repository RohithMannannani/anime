            When man-eating Titans first appeared 100 years ago, humans found
            safety behind massive walls that stopped the giants in their tracks.

            colossal Titan smashes through the barriers, causing a flood of the
            giants into what had been the humans' safe zone. During the carnage
            that follows, soldier Eren Jaeger sees one of the creatures devour
            his mother, which leads him to vow that he will kill every Titan. He
            enlists some friends who survived to help him, and that group is
            humanity's last hope for avoiding extinction at the
            hands of the monsters
